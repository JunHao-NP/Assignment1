Topic Chosen: Website for artists
Artists Chosen: Imagine Dragons

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview of my Project:
This website was created to allow users to get a better understanding of the popular band, Imagine Dragons

Design Process:
This website was made for users who do not know this band that well and for people who know this band, to find out more about the band and any up coming events that are taking place

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
(As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.)
As a user type, I want to be able to find out new events the moment I visit the website.
As a user type, I want to be able to see the videos the band has created when I navigate to the video page.
As a user type, I want to be able to learn more about the band when I navigate to the About page.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
